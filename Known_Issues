# Known Issues

1. Maven fails on compilation step
    - Re-running the task usually fixes it, otherwise have to step manually
2. Python versioning issues
    - Ansible wants use python2 instead of 3 and fails on installing python packages step
    - Fix: Install setuptools for python2
    - Set ansible python interperator in playbook variables
3. Postgres peer authentication failing for user "postgres"
    - Fix: Modify the pg_hba.conf file for postgres and change "peer" to "trust" for user postgres. Restart postgresql
4. Kibana config issue
    - /etc/kibana/kibana.yml config still has the elasticsearch on http://localhost:9200, if localhost is NOT your host name, change it to be the FQDN of your elasticsearch server.
5. Make sure these ports are open:
    - 5601: Kibana
    - 9200, 9300: elasticsearch
    - 8441, 9000: wifimon
6. Wifimon ./start.sh task not daemonized, will stop running when task is completed
    - Temp Fix: manually run start.sh
    - Better Solution: Daemonize agent so that it can run in background or as a systemctl/systemd service
